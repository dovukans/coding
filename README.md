# Coding

This section contains various coding artifacts related to system administration, automation, and scripting.

## Structure

- `scripting/`  
  Scripts for automating repetitive tasks — especially those related to vulnerability fixes, config hardening, etc.  
  ✅ Ideal for anyone tired of editing conf files manually.

## Purpose

The goal here is to gather, document, and share practical, real-world scripts and code snippets that can make sysadmins' lives easier.

All scripts are written with clarity, reusability, and echo-friendly verbosity.
