Scripts for common configuration hardening & vulnerability mitigation tasks, written to save time and reduce human error in daily sysadmin tasks.

## 🔧 What's in here?

This repo contains small, purpose-built Bash and PowerShell scripts that:

Automate common system hardening steps

Echo what changes are being made for clarity

Use dynamic values when possible (no hardcoded paths or users)

Work on systems where you usually have to dig through manuals or Stack Overflow


💡 Why I made this
As a sysadmin, I found myself repeating the same manual configuration edits across different Linux distros and Windows servers.
So instead of fixing the same 10 things on 10 servers, I decided to script once, apply many — and share what I use.

These are the scripts I actually use in production environments.
Sometimes they're minimal, sometimes verbose — but always practical.

⚠️ Disclaimer
These scripts modify system configs — test in a lab before deploying in production.
